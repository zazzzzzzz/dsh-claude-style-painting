 * build.mjs — assemble `lib/client.js` from the `src/` fragments and stylesheets.
 *
 * The shipped client bundle is a single self-contained file (the DSH module
 * loader has no relative requires and no asset URLs for plugin clients), so the
 * source is split for maintenance and inlined back at build time:
 *
 *   src/constants.js             constants & tokens (evaluated to substitute
 *                                %%TOKEN%% placeholders); brand SVGs live in src/assets/
 *   src/assets/icons/combine/*.svg     vendor lockups (mark + wordmark in one),
 *                                inlined as JS markup tables
 *   src/assets/mascot/deepy/*.png      Deepy's animation sheets, copied to
 *                                lib/deepy/ for the host half to serve
 *   src/core/                    host accessors, prefs, model copy, i18n, scheduler
 *   src/shared/                  parts more than one feature uses (JS + CSS)
 *   src/theme/*.css              the global look no single feature owns
 *   src/features/<name>/         one feature: its installer, its split
 *                                factories and its stylesheets, side by side
 *   src/entry.js                 apply(): the FEATURES table + exports
 *
 * FRAGMENTS and STYLE_FILES below are the assembly order and the only list of
 * what ships.
 *
 * `src/model-descriptions.json` is not a fragment: it is validated here and
 * copied to `lib/`, where the host half serves it to the browser half at
 * runtime. Model copy is data, so it must not enter the bundle.
 *
 * Fragments are concatenated verbatim (they share one factory scope at
 * runtime), so each fragment must keep its 4-space base indentation and must
 * NOT use import/export.
