/**
 * smoke.cjs — zero-dependency smoke test of the BUILT plugin (`lib/`); no running
 * DSH instance is needed.
 *
 * Host half, in Node: `host/index.js` is applied to a fake cordis context and the
 * username and session-delete routes get the request shapes that matter
 * (docs/architecture.md D11) — a cross-site page, a LAN peer and the browser's
 * own same-origin fetch, plus the deletion route's own guards (POST only, the id
 * shape, an open session, a path-shaped id) and a real deletion against a
 * scratch harness home under .debug/ — once through a host that offers
 * `connection.requestRejection()` and once through the local stand-in. The
 * public prefix route serves Deepy's sheets from lib/deepy/ and nothing else.
 *
 * Browser half, in headless Chrome/Edge over CDP: `lib/client.js` is loaded into
 * a page that stands in for the host (module loader, ctx, a sidebar footer with
 * an account menu and two plugin entries, a composer whose editor handles Enter
 * the way the host's keymap does), and checked for:
 *   - boot       apply() installs every feature and registers its teardown;
 *   - idle       once settled, no scheduler pass runs — a pass that mutates the
 *                DOM schedules the next one, and then the page never idles;
 *   - enter      Enter on an open composer menu reaches the host, never "Send";
 *   - popovers   the shared popover rule: a pointer crossing a trigger opens
 *                nothing before the dwell elapses, and whichever card opens last
 *                folds the one before it — the skin's own cards and the host's
 *                hero menu alike;
 *   - desktop    the 0.1.7 desktop footer: the host's own account row is the
 *                entry, and our container is injected into its account menu —
 *                first child, self-healing across a host re-render, reachable
 *                by the host's keyboard walk, and gone when the menu closes;
 *   - markup     strings from settings, the account service and plugins render
 *                as text, never as markup;
 *   - isolation  a host API that breaks one feature — at install or at sync —
 *                retires only that feature and hands its surface back (D12);
 *   - deepy      the DeepSeek brand: the whale stands on the home card and on
 *                the conversation's input area (or the panel replacing its
 *                card), follows the session's state and moments, changes
 *                frames without waking a pass, and leaves with the page;
 *   - teardown   dispose leaves no skin node, marker, body attribute or
 *                stylesheet behind, and no pass runs afterwards.
 *
 * This file is the runner. The parts live in scripts/smoke/: shared.cjs (paths,
 * fixtures, `check`), host-half.cjs (the Node half), page.cjs (one case's
 * stand-in page), stand-in.js and probe.js (the scripts that page runs before
 * and after the bundle) and cases.cjs (what each case's report must show).
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/smoke.cjs        (CHROME_PATH overrides the browser lookup)
 * Exit:  0 every check passed · 1 a check failed · 2 the browser half could not run
