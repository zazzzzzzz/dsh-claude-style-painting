    /**
     * A feature's handle on the shared `ui` registry. The scheduler calls the
     * hooks; every hook is optional, and a feature that does not implement one
     * is simply skipped for that trigger. The scheduler reads nothing else from
     * a handle except `sync`, which decides pass order.
     *
     * @typedef {Object} FeatureHandle
     * @property {Function} [sync] Every scheduler pass. The one hook a pass
     *     feature must have.
     * @property {Function} [owns] `owns(target) → boolean`: whether the press
     *     landed inside the feature's own DOM. A press the feature does not own
     *     closes it through `close('outside')`.
     * @property {Function} [onPointerDown] `onPointerDown(target)`: every
     *     pointer press, owned or not. The composer focuses its editor from
     *     here; settingsNav uses it because its class changes are outside the
     *     observer's attributeFilter, so no pass fires.
     * @property {Function} [close] `close(reason)`: `'outside'` (press
     *     outside), `'escape'` (Esc), or `'composer'` (focus moved into the
     *     composer). Features ignore the reasons they do not act on, so each
     *     keeps its exact shipped dismiss routes.
     * @property {Function} [onInput] `onInput(target)`: an input or
     *     compositionend event whose target is inside the composer input.
     * @property {Function} [onFocusIn] `onFocusIn(target)`: every focusin,
     *     after the composer route. The search palette takes over when the
     *     host's own sidebar search input receives focus (its Ctrl+K).
     * @property {Function} [reposition] `reposition(reason)`: `'viewport'` (a
     *     viewport scroll or resize) or `'composer'` (the composer card changed
     *     size). A popover checks whether it is open; the composer keeps the
     *     transcript at its end on a card change.
     * @property {Function} [onCopyChange] `onCopyChange()`: the locale, the
     *     preferences or the model copy changed.
     * @property {Function} [onKey] `onKey(event) → boolean`: a keydown, after
     *     the scheduler's own Esc handling. The return value does not gate the
     *     scheduler's unconditional Ctrl+, preventDefault.
     * @property {Function} [onActivity] `onActivity()`: the reader moved the
     *     pointer, pressed it or pressed a key (the skin's own synthetic Esc
     *     aside). Deepy falls asleep after a quiet minute and wakes on the next
     *     one; the hook only records the moment, so a pointer sweep costs no
     *     pass.
     *
     * Cross-feature reads outside the scheduler stay direct handle reads:
     *   copy, permissions → composer.{isHero, isActive}
     *   heroMenu → composer.isActive
     *   mascot → composer.heroCard
     *   effort → model.{seat, trigger, effort, named, settled, pickEffort, close}
     *   model → effort.close, composer.isActive
     *   quickProviders → model.{providers, onProviders}
     *   footer → ban.open
