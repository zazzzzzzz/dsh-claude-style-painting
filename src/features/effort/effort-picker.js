    /**
     * The reasoning-effort picker: its own seat trigger and its own card.
     *
     * The model card used to carry the effort slider in its footer, so picking a
     * model and picking how hard it thinks were the same gesture. They are two
     * decisions with two different cadences — the model changes rarely, the level
     * is nudged often — so the level now owns a trigger of its own beside the
     * model's, and a card of its own. The model card keeps only the model list
     * and the More-models row.
     *
     * Everything else follows the model picker's discipline: the trigger is
     * created once and reused, the card is a fixed-position sibling on <body>,
     * hover opens it under the "all" scope and click does so otherwise, and the
     * slider element is NEVER detached once built — re-inserting it restarts its
     * CSS animations (the name's blur-in, the apex matrix's entrance sweep),
     * which is exactly the flicker the model footer used to cause on every host
     * round-trip.
     *
     * @param ctx - the plugin context (unused; kept for the installer shape).
     * @param ui - the shared UI registry. `ui.model` provides the seat element
     *   (`seat()`), the model trigger (`trigger()`), the catalog's state
     *   (`effort()`, `named()`, `settled()`), the commit call (`pickEffort()`)
     *   and `close()`.
     * @returns a teardown function.
