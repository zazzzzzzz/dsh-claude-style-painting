    /**
     * The hero row's two pickers — the workspace (directory) chip and the
     * agent-preset seat — both open the host's shared menu primitive, which
     * portals its card to <body>. That card carries no marker of its own, so a
     * stylesheet cannot tell it apart from the host's other menus (sidebar row
     * menus, the settings permission row, submenus) — and it has to: this skin
     * redraws these two and leaves the rest alone.
     *
     * So the browser half stamps the open card rather than guessing in CSS.
     * While either trigger reports `aria-expanded="true"`, the one host menu
     * sitting in <body> is that card; HERO_MENU_ATTR is what
     * features/hero-menu/hero-menu.css switches on, and its value (`workspace` or
     * `preset`) names the picker, since the two cards are drawn differently.
     *
     * The scheduler's attributeFilter does not watch `aria-expanded`, but the
     * card is inserted into <body> as it opens — a childList mutation the pass
     * already observes — so the stamp lands on the frame the menu appears. Two
     * candidates mean an unrelated menu is open as well: the pass then leaves
     * every card alone rather than stamping the wrong one.
     *
     * The host drops that card below its trigger, which is exactly where the
     * composer sits: it would land on the input area and on the controls in it.
     * This row sits above the composer, so the card is placed the way the skin's
     * own composer pickers sit on their triggers — right-aligned with the
     * trigger and opening upward, flipped below it only when the viewport leaves
     * no room above. The host re-places the card from its own geometry on every
     * frame while the card is open, and an inline `left` / `top` written here
     * would live only until the host's next frame. The position therefore
     * travels in two custom properties, which the host's style writes never
     * touch, and
     * features/hero-menu/hero-menu.css reads them with `!important`: an author
     * `!important` declaration outranks the host's plain inline value, so the
     * card holds this position from the pass that stamps it onward. The
     * scheduler's scroll/resize hook re-applies it when the anchor moves.
     *
     * Hover is the host's own click handler driven from here: the "Open popovers
     * on hover" preference's `all` scope covers these two, and the host offers no
     * hover of its own. The listeners are delegated from the document because
     * React replaces the triggers, and the close waits out the gap between the
     * trigger and the card so crossing it does not shut the menu.
