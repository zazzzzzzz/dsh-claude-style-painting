     * The crab that sits on the studio home page's composer: Claude Code's own
     * pixel mascot, perched on the card's top edge near its right end. The
     * classic home page keeps its centred hero without it.
     *
     * It stands still facing the reader. When it is clicked, when the pointer
     * leaves it, and now and then on its own while the hero page stays up, it
     * plays Claude Code's fishing routine: a blink, a rod raised overhead and
     * cast down past the card's edge, a hop into a side-on stance, a spell of
     * fishing, and the rod reeled in as it turns back. A reader who asks the
     * system for reduced motion gets the routine only by clicking the crab.
     *
     * The frames are Claude Code's animation cut into two strips the build
     * inlines (src/assets/mascot): the crab in its colours, and the rod as a
     * mask the stylesheet fills with the theme's quiet ink. A frame change
     * writes one custom property on the crab's own node — the `style`
     * attribute, which the scheduler's observer does not watch — so the
     * routine never wakes a pass. The card comes from the composer's own
     * reading (`ui.composer.heroCard`), and the crab is the skin's own node
     * appended to it, re-appended when the host replaces the card.
     *
     * The DeepSeek brand puts Deepy the pixel whale on the composer instead
     * (src/features/mascot/whale.js), and the crab leaves the page.
     *
     * @param ctx - client context.
     * @param ui - shared handle table.
     * @returns teardown.
