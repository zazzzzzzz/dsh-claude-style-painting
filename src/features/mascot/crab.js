    /**
     * The composer crab — Claude Code's pixel crab — as a mascot character
     * (src/features/mascot/mascot-player.js plays it; src/features/mascot/
     * mascot.js decides which mascot is out).
     *
     * Its animations share Deepy's keys, so the one state machine drives both
     * (CRAB_SHEETS, drawn by scripts/draw-crab.py). Between jobs it looks
     * around, waves, or now and then pulls out its laptop and types for a
     * while — Claude Code's own routine, whole. The sheets ride the bundle
     * as data URIs (CRAB_SHEET_URLS): each animation is a sheet in the crab's
     * colours and an ink mask the stylesheet fills with the theme's quiet ink
     * (the laptop, the thought bubble, letters, notes, the hat), so every
     * sheet is ready the moment it is wanted.
     *
     * @param ctx - client context.
     * @param ui - shared handle table (`ui.composer`).
     * @returns `{ sync, release, onActivity, dispose }`.
