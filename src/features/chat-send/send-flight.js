     * The send bubble's take-off, ported from dsh-chat-ux.

     * After a submission the host mounts an echo bubble at once and swaps it for
     * the real row the moment that arrives. Measured: the echo lives 159 ms while
     * the real row takes over a second. An animation hung on either node is dead on
     * arrival (on the echo it loses its node midway; waiting for the real row leaves
     * a second of nothing), so this draws a stand-in of its own: a copy of the
     * composer card lifts off and narrows into the bubble as it travels. How the
     * stand-in is built and how the shape is worked out is in send-morph.js; this
     * module decides when it takes off, where it flies and when it lands.
     *
     *   capture   the submission's capture phase takes the whole composer card
     *             (clone, geometry, looks), all before React clears the draft.
     *   notice    the echo row is noticed the moment it mounts, through a
     *             MutationObserver rather than a per-frame poll.
     *   launch    the stand-in goes on the page and the whole animation goes to
     *             the compositor; the real row is marked and hidden (keeping its
     *             layout box, so the destination can be measured every frame).
     *   per frame exactly two things: how far the destination moved (the host
     *             scrolling to the end, the echo becoming the real row) is added to
     *             the stand-in's outer layer; and once the shape's stretch is over,
     *             the shell is normalised (see send-morph.js's compact). Position,
     *             shape, colour and the words' re-flow are all on the compositor,
     *             so they keep moving while the host parses a response on the main
     *             thread.
     *   land      unmark and drop the stand-in — the real row is already at the
     *             destination, so the hand-over moves nothing.
     *
     * Five edges:
     *
     *   Hide in the same frame   the observer's callback runs before this frame
     *                            paints, so the real row is never shown for a frame;
     *                            a frame later the reader sees a normal bubble
     *                            flash and then be wiped.
     *   Notice outside the frame  "at once" is not "every frame": the echo being
     *                            swapped for the real row is recognised
     *                            synchronously before this frame paints, and asking
     *                            again in the frame is wasted work.
     *   No origin, no flight     when the origin cannot be captured (a keyboard
     *                            shortcut, a programmatic submission) nothing is
     *                            done and the reader sees the host's own behaviour.

     *   One screen only          with either end off screen the stand-in would
     *                            vanish at the edge and the message would look like
