     * The token reveal's engine, ported from dsh-chat-ux: new characters arrive
     * faint and settle to their own colour.
     *
     * The reveal is a change of the text's own alpha, not a swap of colours:
     * characters arrive faint and come to rest, with nothing repainted in some
     * highlight colour. ::highlight() accepts no opacity — its property set is
     * small and does not include it — so alpha rides on `color`, one rule per
     * step (reveal-rules.css).
     *
     * The engine keeps its scope inside the streaming containers: the step rules
     * are scoped under [data-streaming], so elements outside one are filtered out
     * by their ancestor during style matching and pay nothing, and the observer
     * only looks at what changes inside a streaming container. The step count is
     * bounded by what those rules cost: 24 already reads as a continuous fade.
     *
     * A character is drawn the moment it arrives, at the faintest step, by a
     * synchronous paint right after the scan — a scheduled frame would leave one
     * frame of full-strength text, which the eye reads as a flash.
     *
     * @returns a disposer, or null when the browser has no Custom Highlight API.
     *     The reader's animation choice is the installer's business
     *     (chat-reveal.js), which has to take a running engine down with it.
