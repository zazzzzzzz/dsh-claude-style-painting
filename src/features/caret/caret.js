     * The composer caret's motion, ported from dsh-chat-ux: the browser's own
     * caret is pressed down and one is drawn in its place, so moving it can
     * carry a transition.
     *
     * The browser's caret has no animatable property beyond its colour and its
     * blink, so a transition has only one road: make it transparent and draw
     * one. Two surfaces under the composer seat are taken over — the
     * contenteditable input (measured through the collapsed Range the browser
     * keeps, caret-measure.js) and a textarea inside the seat, such as a
     * question card's answer box or a queued message's inline editor (measured
     * through a hidden mirror, caret-measure.js).
     *
     * What the mode means (the settings page's three-way choice):
     *
     *   typing  every move transitions, which is the default;
     *   move    only explicit moves (an arrow key, a click) transition — a
     *           keystroke lands instantly, told apart by the frame's input;
     *   off     nothing is taken over at all: no drawn caret, no mark, the
     *           browser's own caret throughout. That road is also the fallback,
     *           because the one way this effect really hurts a reader is a
     *           caret that cannot be seen.
     *
     * Two more rules, both measured in a real Chromium: the first frame the
     * drawn caret appears writes its place with no transition (otherwise it
     * slides in from wherever it last was), and a measurement that fails hands
     * the native caret back rather than leaving the surface with none.
