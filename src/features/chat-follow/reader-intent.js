     * Whether an event is the reader taking the scroll over.
     *
     * Three readers ask the same question — the follow guard, the fold glide's
     * hand-back and the process body's catch-up — so the test lives in one
     * place and cannot drift apart in their own edits. Two rules, the same
     * everywhere: a pointer or key inside the composer is the reader typing,
     * and of the keys only the ones that scroll the viewport count. Which
     * event types each reader listens to is that reader's own decision.
     *
     * @param event - any pointer, touch or key event on the page.
     * @returns false for an event inside the composer, or a key that cannot scroll.
