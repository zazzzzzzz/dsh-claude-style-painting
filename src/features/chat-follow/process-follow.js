     *
     * The standard and compact tiers cap one process group's body (a max
     * height with its own scrollbar), and the host follows that body with a
     * native smooth scroll. Two things make it miss while content streams:
     *
     *   travel  a native smooth scroll eases out as it nears its target, and
     *           the content grows at a steady rate instead — a thinking section
     *           followed by tool output grows no slower than the scroll.
     *   single  the host starts the next one only once the previous has landed,
     *           so anything the content grows meanwhile waits.
     *
     * Together they leave the position 20 to 50 px off the end — exactly the
     * last two lines. Nothing here changes the host's own state: past
     * CATCH_UP_GAP_PX the catch-up walks the body's scrollTop to its end on a
     * curve (scroll-ease.js, so the text above the last line is pushed up
     * smoothly rather than in a jump), and inside that threshold it leaves the
     * host's smooth scroll alone, which is the pleasant one while it keeps up.
     * The reader scrolling inside a body hands that body over until he comes
     * back to its end.
     *
     * The catch-up and the host's own follow do not fight: moving scrollTop
     * runs its onScroll, and it reads a position at the end as the reader
     * reaching the end — which lights its follow up again and drops the
     * animation target that was stuck.
