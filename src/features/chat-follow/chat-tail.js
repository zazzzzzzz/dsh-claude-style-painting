    /**
     * Hand the chat area's scroll position back to the host's own follow.
     *
     * The host's follow is switched off by a scroll that looks like the reader
     * moving and does not reach the end: that scroll enters its 500 ms sampling
     * window, in which a resize follows nothing, and the settlement compares
     * position rather than intent — so the host's own focus(), a browser clamp
     * and any programmatic write all read as the reader having moved. The
     * structural moments are exactly where that happens: a thinking row folds,
     * a tool row arrives, a process group opens, and each one both moves the
     * position and delivers a burst of content inside that window.
     *
     * The host leaves one way back in: the "back to the end" button it renders
     * only while the follow is off, whose click clears the sampling window,
     * lights the follow up again and reaches the end at once. Both ways are
     * used here, in this order:
     *
     *   pin     the position is walked to the end on a curve (scroll-ease.js),
     *           so the text above the last line is pushed up smoothly rather
     *           than snapping. Any displacement at all makes the host's own
     *           onScroll take the "reader reached the end" branch — which does
     *           not ask whether the follow is on — so it lights the follow up
     *           and clears the window. With the position already at the end
     *           nothing changes.
     *   click   no displacement means no scroll event, so the pin is a no-op.
     *           That is the start of an execution, when the content has not
     *           grown a scrollbar yet: the end is 0 and the position is 0, and
     *           writing either one is still 0. Only the button works there,
     *           because its own followTail() needs no displacement.
     *
     * The looks in between are needed: the host often turns the follow off a
     * beat late, once its sampling window settles, and five looks cover that
     * window.
