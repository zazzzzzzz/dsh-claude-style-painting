    /**
     * A running process group opens by default and folds back once the piece of
     * work ends (the final answer is due).
     *
     * The host gathers a turn's adjacent process content — reasoning, tool calls,
     * commands, file writes — into one process group, opened and closed by its own
     * inline control. In the compact and standard tiers the body starts folded,
     * so the reader has to open it to see what the model is doing. The detailed
     * and fully-expanded tiers do not cap the body (it is open throughout), and
     * this module leaves them alone entirely — the test is the group root's
     * data-group-expanded-mode.
     *
     * A group's phase is read off the shimmer in its header: the host attaches
     * data-shimmer (data-text-shimmer before its 2026-09 update) only while the
     * process section is still running. Whether the body is open is its own
     * hidden attribute — the host hides searchably, setting hidden="until-found"
     * when folded and removing it entirely when open. Both are semantic
     * attributes. Command cards inside the group use the shimmer too, so the
     * phase is only ever asked of the header.
     *
     * The group still belongs to the reader: a reader who touched a group in a
     * phase keeps it for that phase. The hand-over is per phase — folding a group
     * while its process still runs means he does not want to watch it right now,
     * and folding it back when the section ends would mean nothing.
