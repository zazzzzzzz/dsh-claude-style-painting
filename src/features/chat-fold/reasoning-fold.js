     * pins it with a plain useState(false), and no setting exposes it. The row's
     * own expand control is the one lever this feature can pull, and at least
     * that lever is stable — the row carries data-variant="think", data-state
     * (running while the model reasons, ok once it stops) and data-expanded,
     * all semantic attributes rather than the hashed class names around them.
     *
     * The row still belongs to the reader. A press or a key inside it records
     * the phase it happened in, and this module leaves the row alone for that
     * phase: folded mid-reasoning it stays folded, and a stopped row opened by
     * hand stays open. The hand-over is deliberately per phase rather than per
     * row — folding and unfolding while the model reasons is not a request to
     * keep it open once the reasoning stops, so the ok phase still folds it.
