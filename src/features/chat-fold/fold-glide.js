    /**
     * When a fold closes, the content below is pushed away and the body rolls up
     * like a door.
     *
     * The host's DisclosureRow unmounts the body whole when it closes ({open &&
     * children}), so CSS has no old value to transition from and a pure CSS
     * height animation is impossible in the chat area. This takes over outside
     * the DOM by intercepting the click: stopPropagation() in the capture phase,
     * so React never sees it and the real element stays where it is, still open,
     * and can have its height pressed down. When the press reaches the end the
     * click is handed back as it was. Pressing the real element means there is no
     * clone and none of a clone's trouble (inheritance, coordinates, scrolling,
     * node limits).
     *
     *   opening   acts after React has inserted the body — the observer callback
     *             still runs before paint, so the height can be pressed back to
     *             the start and animated to full while the layout grows frame by
     *             frame. The content below is really pushed away, with no FLIP.
     *   closing   intercepts the click and keeps the element open, so its height
     *             can be pressed to the end just as in the opening direction, and
     *             only then lets the click through: React unmounts an element
     *             that takes no space, so the collapsed layout does not jump.
     *
     * What gets pressed depends on the family:
     *
     *   a DisclosureRow    the body itself; it is a plain block with no inner scroll.
     *   a process group    the group root, not its body. The body carries its own
     *                      scrollbar and the host's use-process-scroll watches it:
     *                      pressing it would make follow.toBottom smooth-scroll the
     *                      content to the end and turn the door into a column of
     *                      text running upwards. The root is only the box around
     *                      it — the body inside keeps every pixel of its size, so
     *                      the host's follow receives no ResizeObserver notice,
     *                      while the root's height is part of the layout and still
     *                      pushes the content below away.
     *   not at all         a turn's header (the "took X seconds" button) and its
     *                      trigger notice: what they open is a whole turn's
     *                      content, nested scrolls included, and the host's own
     *                      instant toggle is the steadier answer there.
     *
     * The door only rolls what can be seen. The height has to travel from start
     * to end for the layout to really make room, but the animation's distance is
     * the full height: eight thousand pixels of reasoning would run out in 200 ms
     * and look like a pop. So the height runs in two stretches, and the boundary
     * is the visible reach foldVisibleReach measures — the stretch the reader can
     * see gets FOLD_VISIBLE_SHARE of the duration, and the height outside the
     * viewport takes the rest in one go. A door two hundred pixels tall and one
     * twenty thousand tall then move at the same speed in front of the reader,
     * and the two stretches are continuous rather than a jump.
     *
     * An intent is only taken from a reader's own click, and it only keeps one
     * number: the starting height for the opening direction. Streaming additions
     * and paging through history have no click and so no animation; this
     * feature's own automatic folding dispatches real clicks down this very
     * capture path, so those are recognised through isChatFoldToggle and let
     * through — there the content is meant to grow naturally.
     *
     * @returns teardown: the click listener and the observer go away.
