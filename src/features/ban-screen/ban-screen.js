     * touches the host, the session, or the preference store — the overlay is
     * one node appended to `<body>` and removed again on the way out.
     *
     * Entry is the account row at the top of the sidebar footer's account
     * popover (src/features/account/account-footer.js binds that row to
     * `ui.ban.open()`). Exit follows the way in — every control the page
     * paints ("Sign out", "Request a review", the two "What you can do" rows,
     * the toast's dismiss button, the window controls) closes it, and Esc
     * closes it (scheduler.js's global key handler). Nothing inside the overlay
     * performs the action its label names.
     *
     * Losing focus does NOT close it, on purpose. The page is something to
     * READ: the reader has to switch windows to look something up, and an
     * overlay that vanishes the moment they do is worse than one that waits.
     * Leaving is always an explicit act — a control on the page or Esc.
     *
     * Layout note: the overlay is `position: fixed` at the top of the stacking
     * order rather than a real page, so it covers the whole window (sidebar,
     * titlebar, composer) whatever the host renders underneath — and it can
     * never be clipped by the sidebar column, which the account popover itself
     * has to work around.

       * units — the ban screen paints this in a 75px box, so the ink lands at
