## Preview

The settings page's Brand mark row switches between the Claude and DeepSeek palettes, and light/dark follows your system's color mode. In each group the top row is the Studio home page and the bottom row a Markdown conversation, light on the left and dark on the right.

### Claude

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/claude-home-light.png" alt="Claude brand, Studio home — light" /></td>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/claude-home-dark.png" alt="Claude brand, Studio home — dark" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/claude-conversation-light.png" alt="Claude brand, Markdown conversation — light" /></td>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/claude-conversation-dark.png" alt="Claude brand, Markdown conversation — dark" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

> Light mode pairs an ivory canvas `#FCFCFB` with a pale sidebar `#FBFBF9`; dark mode uses warm black `#141413`. Ember orange `#D97757` is the single action accent across both canvases, and Claude Code's pixel crab stands on the Studio home page's composer.

### DeepSeek

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/deepseek-home-light.png" alt="DeepSeek brand, Studio home — light" /></td>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/deepseek-home-dark.png" alt="DeepSeek brand, Studio home — dark" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/deepseek-conversation-light.png" alt="DeepSeek brand, Markdown conversation — light" /></td>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/deepseek-conversation-dark.png" alt="DeepSeek brand, Markdown conversation — dark" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

> Light mode is a white with a touch of sky blue, `#F7FAFF`, with the sidebar at `#F3F7FE`; dark mode is a blue-black `#13161D`. The accent is DeepSeek's brand blue `#4D6BFE`, and Deepy the pixel whale stands on the composer on the home page and in conversations alike.

## Artwork

> A standing character sits behind the main column, with its doodles, line drawings and small trinkets along the column's edges; the canvas hands its flat colour over to the artwork itself. The character the package ships is **Diana**, with its files taken from the painting-skin-theme pack.
>
> The settings page's Artwork row turns the layer off entirely, and the canvas returns to its flat colour. Both the character table and the files live in the package's `assets/` directory: `assets/themes.json` names each character's files, its aspect ratio and its three line colours, and `assets/<character id>/` holds the files themselves. Adding a character means dropping in the files and adding one table entry — no code change and no rebuild.
>
> A motion character (a WebM with an alpha channel) plays through a `<video>` in the same box, with its still frame as the poster and the fallback; choosing Reduced under Animation holds it on that still frame.

## Fonts

> **Important: the Anthropic fonts are not bundled with the npm package.** They are available for download in this repository under [`fonts/`](fonts/). You can either install them on your system, or skip the install entirely — drop the two `.ttf` files into the plugin package's `fonts/` directory and the host will serve them as webfonts (the files are identical, so the result is the same). Either way, refresh or restart the web UI for the fonts to take effect.

| Font | Used for | File |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Sans Web Text | Interface / UI | [`fonts/AnthropicSansWebText.ttf`](https://github.com/Nwflower/dsh-claude-style/raw/main/fonts/AnthropicSansWebText.ttf) |
| Anthropic Serif Web Text | Conversation body / Markdown | [`fonts/AnthropicSerifWebText.ttf`](https://github.com/Nwflower/dsh-claude-style/raw/main/fonts/AnthropicSerifWebText.ttf) |
| JetBrains Mono Variable | Code / code blocks | [`fonts/JetBrainsMonoVariable.ttf`](https://github.com/Nwflower/dsh-claude-style/raw/main/fonts/JetBrainsMonoVariable.ttf), [`fonts/JetBrainsMonoItalicVariable.ttf`](https://github.com/Nwflower/dsh-claude-style/raw/main/fonts/JetBrainsMonoItalicVariable.ttf) |

To enable the Anthropic fonts, choose one of the following:

① Install them on your system — on Windows, double-click each `.ttf` and choose "Install"; on macOS, import them with Font Book.

② Skip the install — copy the `.ttf` files into the plugin package's `fonts/` directory, then refresh the page.

> The Anthropic Sans and Serif fonts are the property of Anthropic, licensed for personal use only, and are not covered by this project's MIT license.

## Installation

1. From the official plugin page, add the plugin below and it installs.

```
dsh-claude-style
```

2. From a terminal:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-claude-style                  # npm package (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add Nwflower/dsh-claude-style         # GitHub source
```

3. From the [plugin market](https://github.com/dsh-market/dsh-market)

Keep only one theme enabled at a time. dsh ≥ 0.1.7 is required, and a restart of DeepSeek Harness brings the full feature set.
